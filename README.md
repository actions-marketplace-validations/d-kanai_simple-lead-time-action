# simple-lead-time-action

## Motivation

we would like to know how long take time until release our commited code.
it's like lead-time in one of Four keys

## Definition of lead-time

- we have "release" branch
- we have "devlelop" branch
- we merge "develop" => "release" branch by PR when we deploy to production as usual

so that 

* Lead Time = PR merged date - PR first commited date *
